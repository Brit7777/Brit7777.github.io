Hi, my name is Jooyoung Lee and I'm a first year PhD student in Informatics at [Pennsylvania State University](https://ist.psu.edu). My primary research interest is `Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and Privacy`. I am currently working with Dr.Shomir Wilson ([HLT lab](https://hltlab.org)) and Dr.Sarah Rajtmajer. I completed my Bachelors degree in Computer Science at Sookmyung Women's University, South Korea.

I have a strong technical background, and most importantly, I am passinate about everything that is data-driven! I am familiar with programming languages including Python, Java, JavaScript, C, C++, and HTML. If you would like to learn more about me, here is my [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1K0DzMxoNdIH66c3XENyyZi_7a750U3z9/preview).
